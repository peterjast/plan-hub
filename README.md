# Plan Hub
Do you have a child that has trouble staying on task? Maybe they just need a little incentive boost and a little bit of structure.  Plan Hub makes completing tasks and chores fun and rewarding. Parents can use our tool to set up a list of tasks to be completed by their child, add rewards to incentivize productivity, and monitor the completion of these tasks. Using the kids corner, kids can update their to do list as they complete tasks and can select a reward when they complete their list.

## Tools:
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express
* Express-handlebars
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Passport
* bcrypt
* uuid
* Heroku

## How the app works

* **Click register to get started** 
    * Once a parent registers, they will be brought to a page to create tasks and rewards
    * On the kid's corner page, a child can click a task once completed.
    * Once all tasks are completed, children are prompted to choose from one of the rewards their parent has created.
